<p>Two Chinese Yaogan military reconnaissance satellites launched this week, riding a Long March 2C booster into orbit on a mission that inaugurated the use of a new restartable upper stage to increase the rocket&#8217;s carrying capacity.</p>
<p>The two Yaogan 32 satellites, designated Yaogan 32-01 and 32-02, lifted off from the Jiuquan space center in remote northwestern China at 0243 GMT Tuesday (10:43 p.m. EDT Monday), according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>The launch occurred at 10:43 a.m. Beijing time Tuesday.</p>
<p>Topped by a Yuanzheng 1S upper stage, the Long March 2C rocket climbed away from Jiuquan in China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia region to place the Yaogan 32 satellites into a roughly 430-mile-high (nearly 700-kilometer) orbit.</p>
<p>U.S. military tracking data indicated the satellites were deployed in an orbit with a track angled 98.3 degrees to the equator, enabling near-global coverage.</p>
<p>But details on the purpose of the Yaogan 32 satellites remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Xinhua reported the satellites &#8220;will be used for electromagnetic environment surveys and other related technology tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Satellites in the Yaogan series are typically used by the Chinese military, including spacecraft to test new technologies and capture high-resolution surveillance imagery. Xinhua often offers no details on the design or specific missions of such satellites.</p>
<p>The Yuanzheng 1S upper stage is based on a similiar restartable space tug previously used to deliver Chinese Beidou navigation satellites to their intended orbits thousands of miles above the planet.</p>
<p>The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology said the Yuanzheng 1S upper stage variant is a simplified version of the Yuanzheng 1 designed for short flights. Xinhua reported the new upper stage will be mainly used for commercial launches.</p>
<p>Yuanzheng is the Chinese word for expedition.</p>
<p>With the addition of the Yuanzheng 1S upper stage, the Long March 2C rocket can place a payload of up to two metric tons (about 4,400 pounds) into sun-synchronous orbit, a popular destination for Earth observation spacecraft. Without the upper stage, the Long March 2C&#8217;s lift capability to the same type of orbit is 1.2 metric tons (about 2,650 pounds).</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s launch was the 27th of the year by China, which has conducted more satellite launches than any other nation so far in 2018.</p>

<p>A normally reliable Soyuz FG rocket malfunctioned two minutes after liftoff from Kazakhstan Thursday, forcing a Russian cosmonaut and his NASA crewmate to execute an emergency abort and a steep-but-safe return to Earth a few hundred miles from the launch site. Russian recovery crews reported the crew came through the ordeal in good shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin are in good condition following today&#8217;s aborted launch,&#8221; NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted from Kazakhstan. &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that everyone is safe. A thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASA</a> astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin are in good condition following today&#39;s aborted launch. I’m grateful that everyone is safe. A thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted. Full statement below: <a href="https://t.co/M76yisHaKF">pic.twitter.com/M76yisHaKF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1050337299542753280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ovchinin and Hague blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 4:40 a.m. EDT (GMT-4; 2:40 p.m. local time), kicking off what was expected to be a four-orbit six-hour flight to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>But two minutes and two seconds after liftoff, just a few seconds after the rocket&#8217;s four liquid-fueled strap-on boosters separated from the central core stage, something went wrong. Long-range tracking cameras showed the strap-ons and what appeared to be multiple other objects falling away from the rocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Failure of the booster,&#8221; a translator called out, presumably relaying a report from Ovchinin to Russian mission control near Moscow. &#8220;Failure of the booster.&#8221; Moments later, he confirmed the Soyuz had separated from the rocket&#8217;s upper stage, saying &#8220;we are in weightlessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moments after that, as the spacecraft plunged back into the thick lower atmosphere, it rapidly decelerated, subjected the crew to nearly seven times the normal force of gravity at one point.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are getting ready for the G loads,&#8221; Ovchinin reported. &#8220;G load is 6.7.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Copy,&#8221; a Russian flight controller replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are feeling rotation, the G load is going down,&#8221; the cosmonaut reported. &#8220;G load is 2.72 and going down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tighten the straps&#8221; for landing, the flight controller called.</p>
<p>Air-to-ground communications with the crew were cut off shortly after that exchange, either because NASA or the Russian space agency opted to keep the loop private, because of a malfunction or because the capsule passed beyond the range of its radio system.</p>
<p>In any case, NASA launch commentator Brandi Dean, monitoring events from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, reported the Soyuz&#8217;s descent module landed near the town of Dzhezkazgan, a familiar staging site for normal Soyuz re-entries and landings, about 250 miles from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</p>
<p>Russian recovery crews dispatched from Baikonur aboard helicopters reached Ovchinin and Hague by radio before arriving at the landing site and reported both crew members were in good shape. Photographs later were posted by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, showing both men relaxing in Dzhezkazgan, chatting with support personnel.</p>

<p>It was not immediately known what might have gone wrong with the Soyuz FG booster, but Dmitri Rogozin, director general of Roscosmos, said a State Commission would investigate the mishap, adding in a tweet &#8220;the Soyuz MS emergency rescue system worked. The crew is saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not yet clear what impact the abort might have on upcoming Russian flights to the space station.</p>
<p>A Progress supply ship is scheduled for launch at the end of the month and the station&#8217;s current crew &#8212; Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst, Serena Auñón-Chancellor and Soyuz MS-09 commander Sergey Prokopyev &#8212; is scheduled to return to Earth on Dec. 13.</p>
<p>Soyuz MS-11 commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain are scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Dec. 20, but it&#8217;s not yet known whether the failure investigation will be complete by then or even which crew &#8212; Ovchinin&#8217;s or Kononenko&#8217;s &#8212; will be on board.</p>
<p>In the near term, two spacewalks planned by Hague and Gerst on Oct. 19 and 25 to replace a set of batteries in the station&#8217;s solar power system will be deferred. Two upcoming U.S. supply ships presumably will launch on schedule in November.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s launch was the first mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since an earlier version of the rocket caught fire on the pad before launch in August 1983, triggering a dramatic abort that subjected Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov to 17 times the force of gravity as the capsule was pulled away fro the exploding rocket. They landed about two and a half miles from the launch pad, shaken but in good health.</p>
<p>The only other Russian manned launch failure occurred in 1975 when the booster&#8217;s second and third stages failed to separate. Vasily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov reached an altitude of 119 miles before descending to a landing about 978 miles from the launch site in the Altai Mountains. The crew was rescued without incident.</p>
<p>The only fatalities in the Russian manned space program occurred during re-entries from orbit. Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed in 1967 when the parachutes in his malfunctioning capsule failed to inflate. Three cosmonauts &#8212; Vladislav Volkov, Georgi Dobrovoiski and Viktor Patsayev &#8212; lost their lives in 1971 when their Soyuz depressurized during descent.</p>
<p>Dean reported the Soyuz MS-10 capsule carried out a &#8220;ballistic&#8221; descent, a normal but steeper-than-usual trajectory heading back to Earth.</p>
<p>Ballistic descents have occurred three times during the space station program, subjecting crews to higher G-loads than normal. But the spacecraft is designed for such descents and the crews were not injured.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s launching appeared normal in its early stages as the rocket climbed away, putting on a spectacular show as it smoothly accelerated toward space atop a long jet of flame from its central core stage and four liquid-fueled strap-on boosters. Looking on were Hague&#8217;s wife and two young children, Bridenstine and other NASA and Russian space agency dignitaries and family members.</p>
<p>Live television views from inside the crew module showed Ovchinin and Hague calmly monitoring cockpit displays as they were pushed back into their seats by the steady acceleration.</p>
<p>The flight was proceeding normally under the power of its second stage core booster when the mishap occurred.</p>
<p>The Russians routinely practice ascent abort procedures and the Soyuz is equipped with multiple systems to assure a safe landing at virtually any point during the climb to space. Before launch, Hague said the Soyuz spacecraft was one of the most reliable ever built.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things I&#8217;ve done over the course of the last two years, we do about three dozen different integrated simulations where they throw every failure they can think of at us.&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gotten an appreciation for just how the Soyuz spacecraft is. We plan for success and also all of the other contingencies and we exercise against all of those different failures and different contingencies and we&#8217;re still able to get the mission done, get to the station and still get home. So, if anything, I&#8217;ve got a very high appreciation for just how solid of a spacecraft it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hague is an Air Force Academy graduate who married a classmate. He said he and his wife were accustomed to risk, but &#8220;it&#8217;s tough&#8221; for his two young boys &#8220;to really comprehend the risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife is active duty Air Force, and so I&#8217;ve stayed at home while she deployed, I&#8217;ve deployed and she stayed at home, we&#8217;ve both been deployed at the same time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we understand the risks associated with it and we have come to appreciate each other and understand that we do the things we do because we&#8217;re committed to serving the country, serving something larger than ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>One week after a Russian Soyuz spacecraft departed the International Space Station and brought three crew members back to Earth, another Soyuz carrying a veteran cosmonaut and a first-time NASA flight engineer is ready for launch Thursday on a quick four-orbit flight to the orbiting lab complex.</p>
<p>Commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Tyler &#8220;Nick&#8221; Hague are scheduled to blast off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 4:40:15 a.m. EDT (GMT-4; 2:40 p.m. local time), roughly the moment Earth&#8217;s rotation carries the Soyuz MS-10/56S spacecraft into the plane of the space station&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Ovchinin and Hague will monitor a series of carefully planned rocket firings during a six-hour rendezvous with the lab complex, moving in for an automated linkup at the upper Poisk module at 10:44 a.m.</p>
<p>Standing by to welcome them on board will be Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst, a German astronaut representing the European Space Agency, Soyuz MS-09/55S commander Sergey Prokopyev and NASA astronaut Serena Auñón-Chancellor.</p>
<p>They have had the station to themselves since Oct. 4 when a previous Soyuz crew &#8212; commander Oleg Artemyev, flight engineer Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold &#8212; returned to Earth, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan to wrap up a 197-day mission.</p>
<p>Soyuz spacecraft are designed to carry crews of three. A second cosmonaut originally planned to join Ovchinin and Hague but he was removed earlier when launch of a Russian lab module he is trained to help install and operate was delayed to late next year.</p>
<p>Ovchinin, a Russian military pilot-instructor and veteran of a 172-day stay aboard the station in 2016, said he looked forward to returning to a room with a view above the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting job, very interesting experiments and very interesting people,&#8221; he told reporters earlier, speaking through a translator. &#8220;We have people from different countries living together, communicating, performing their duties, their mission. Besides, it&#8217;s really enticing to have (an office), so to speak, with this outstanding view out onto planet Earth! This is something I&#8217;m really looking forward to going back to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about his U.S. co-pilot, Ovchinin said Hague is &#8220;very smart, very intelligent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy to train with him, and I think it&#8217;s going to be just the same in flight,&#8221; Ovchinin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very easy to work with him, very comfortable, and I&#8217;m positive he&#8217;s going to fly (in space) a few more times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hague, an Air Force Academy graduate who married a classmate and went on to earn a master&#8217;s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT before becoming a test pilot, is making his first space flight. He was equally complimentary when it came to his commander.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alexey, he is rock solid. Our temperaments mesh well together, we&#8217;re both a little bit on the silent side, but we see things the same way,&#8221; Hague said. &#8220;In working hand in hand with him inside the Soyuz capsule, we&#8217;ve built over the last year a lot of confidence in each other. &#8230; We work really well together, so I&#8217;m fortunate to have him as commander, and I look forward to flying with him.</p>
<p>Hague said he was impressed by the Soyuz and its multiple backup systems. During simulator training, Russian instructors &#8220;throw every failure they can think of at us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last two years, I&#8217;ve gotten an appreciation for just how robust the Soyuz spacecraft is. We plan for success and also all of the other contingencies, and we exercise against all of those different failures. And we&#8217;re still able to get the mission done, get to the station and still get home. I&#8217;ve got a very high appreciation for just how solid of a spacecraft it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with helping pilot the Soyuz, Hague said he was most looking forward to finding out how his body reacts to living and working in the microgravity environment of space.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve listened to all the stories of the astronauts and cosmonauts that come back, and I think the thing I&#8217;m most looking forward to is just experiencing my own adaptation to space,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go up there and I&#8217;m going to float for six months, my feet won&#8217;t need to touch the ground, there&#8217;ll be all kinds of physiological changes that are going to happen to my body and I&#8217;m going to adapt to that environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested to see how it&#8217;s going to affect me, how is that process going to play out? &#8230; There&#8217;s also going to be everyday something that surprises me, because I&#8217;m in a weightless environment. I expect to behave a certain way because of the 42 years I&#8217;ve lived on the ground and when it doesn&#8217;t, those surprises will be little presents along the way that make the flight exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He can expect a bit of excitement right away. Hague and Gerst plan to float outside on Oct. 19 and 25, carrying out two spacewalks to install six new lithium-ion batteries in the station&#8217;s solar power system that were delivered Sept. 27 aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship.</p>
<p>NASA originally planned to install the batteries during two spacewalks, one by Feustel and Gerst and the other by Gerst and Arnold, before the Americans returned to Earth on Oct. 4. But launch of the HTV was delayed nearly two weeks by technical problems and bad weather, prompting mission managers top defer the spacewalks until after Hague&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>Most of the space station&#8217;s electrical power is generated by four huge sets of rotating solar arrays, two on the starboard, or right side of the lab&#8217;s power truss and two on the left, or port side. The batteries deliver power when the station is in Earth&#8217;s shadow and are recharged when the arrays are back in sunlight.</p>
<p>The system originally used 12 batteries for each set of arrays but the replacement units pack twice the punch, so only six are needed per set.</p>
<p>The HTV-6 cargo ship delivered the first set of replacements in December 2016. They were installed on the starboard 4, or S4, solar array segment during two spacewalks in January 2017. The batteries carried up aboard HTV-7 in September will be installed on the left-side port 4, or P4, truss segment by Hague and Gerst.</p>
<p>Ovchinin and Prokopyev may carry out a spacewalk of their own in the next few weeks to inspect the outside of the Soyuz MS-09/55S spacecraft that carried Prokopyev, Gerst and Auñón-Chancellor into orbit June 6.</p>
<p>In September, a small leak was detected and traced to the ferry ship&#8217;s upper orbital module. Apparent drill marks were found indicating a presumably deliberate act at some point during the spacecraft&#8217;s construction or processing. Because the leak occurred well after the ship reached orbit, some have speculated an attempt was made to seal the hole before launch and that the seal eventually failed.</p>
<p>No signs of an earlier seal were found inside the Soyuz, but an external inspection could reveal such evidence, helping investigators pin down what happened and, perhaps, when.</p>
<p>Spacewalks aside, the station crew faces a hectic schedule in the coming months. A Russian Progress cargo ship is scheduled to arrive Nov. 2 followed by a Northrup Grumman supply craft on Nov. 18, a SpaceX Dragon space freighter around the end of November and the departure of Gerst, Prokopyev and Auñón-Chancellor on Dec. 13.</p>
<p>A fresh crew &#8212; Oleg Kononenko, Canadian David Saint-Jacques and Anne McClain &#8212; is scheduled to arrive Dec. 20.</p>
<p>Then in January, in a major milestone, SpaceX plans to launch a new Dragon ferry ship on an unpiloted test flight to the station, followed by a similar test flight in March by a Boeing Starliner capsule. If those flights go well, both companies hope to launch piloted test flights in June and August.</p>
<p>NASA has been forced to rely on the Russian Soyuz to carry astronauts to and from the station since the shuttle program ended in 2011. The SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft will end NASA&#8217;s sole reliance on Russia for crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a critical milestone for us to be able to bring back the means to launch crews from the United States,&#8221; Hague said. &#8220;It improves our robust ability to provide crews to station, both from Russia as well as the United States. That can only help the program in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly, it allows us to increase the number that will be on the station and more crew on station means more science that can get done. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re up there to do, we&#8217;re up there to try to answer the questions we don&#8217;t know the answers to. And so, that&#8217;s going to be an important milestone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ovchinin and Hague plan to return to Earth on April 16, along with a United Arab Emirates guest astronaut. The UAE astronaut will launch to the station on April 5 with Soyuz MS-12/58S commander Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronaut Christina Koch.</p>

<p>A Soyuz rocket poised to send two new crew members to the International Space Station rolled to its launch pad Tuesday at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The Soyuz-FG rocket emerged from an assembly building at the Central Asia spaceport at sunrise Tuesday. Lying on its side, the three-stage launcher rode a specially-designed rail bar to Launch Pad. No. 1 at Baikonur, a historic launch site used in 1961 on the flight of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first person to travel in space.</p>
<p>Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin will occupy the center seat when the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft lifts off at 0840 GMT (4:40 a.m. EDT) Thursday from Baikonur. He will be joined by NASA astronaut Nick Hague in the left seat of the Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p>After a nearly nine-minute climb into orbit, the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft will commence its chase of the International Space Station, with docking planned at 1444 GMT (10:44 a.m. EDT). The arrival of Ovchinin and Hague will raise the station&#8217;s crew complement to five.</p>
<p>The duo plans to stay on the space station until mid-April.</p>

<p>NASA has suspended science operations with the Hubble Space Telescope and put the observatory into protective &#8220;safe mode&#8221; while engineers troubleshoot problems with one of the spacecraft&#8217;s three remaining gyroscopes, used to help aim the telescope and keep it locked on target, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>Ken Sembach, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said the Hubble team is optimistic the problem can be resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people are just taking a wait-and-see attitude,&#8221; he told CBS News in a phone interview. &#8220;The one thing the Hubble team has shown time and again is it&#8217;s resilient, and the observatory is very robust to these kinds of things. We typically figure out what&#8217;s happening and figure out an appropriate course forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody is worried-worried that the mission, say, is coming to an end, because it&#8217;s not. But we may be out of commission for a short period of time here while we understand this and figure out what is the right path forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launched aboard the shuttle Discovery in April 1990, Hubble is one of the most scientifically productive spacecraft ever built, generating a steady stream of astronomical discoveries and iconic photos familiar to millions around the world. NASA hopes to operate the telescope into the early 2020s if not longer.</p>
<p>It is equipped with six sophisticated, high-speed gyroscopes to help it move from target to target and to provide data needed to keep the telescope solidly locked on while its cameras and spectrometers collect data. But only three gyros are needed for normal telescope operation with the others held in reserve.</p>
<p>Three of the gyros are older models that have a history of truoble after 50,000 hours or so of service. The other three are newer-generation models less susceptible to those mechanical failure modes. Engineers believe they could operate for several hundred thousand hours.</p>
<p>In the wake of the fifth and final space shuttle servicing mission in 2009, two of the older-generation gyros failed, one at a time, leaving Hubble with just four operational units. This past Friday night, Hubble was operating normally with two newer gyros and one older model. The third newer unit was being held in reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three of them were on and one was off,&#8221; Sembach said. &#8220;One of the (older-design models) that was on has been acting kind of flaky for a year, and we&#8217;ve expected it to reach its end of life. And, in fact, that actually happened on Friday night. It finally gave up the ghost and failed. Everybody said OK, no big surprise, we&#8217;ve been expecting that for a year, let&#8217;s turn on the gyro that was off at the time to get back onto science operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that gyro experienced problems earlier in the mission, exhibiting unusual &#8220;noise&#8221; in its electrical system. Engineers later developed a software patch to restore normal operation, but the gyro was kept in reserve. Over the weekend, engineers attempted to bring it on line.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we turned it on as planned and the gyro was not reading the rates the way it should,&#8221; Sembach said. &#8220;The gyro thinks there&#8217;s motion occurring when, in fact, there isn&#8217;t. And so, that appears to be an issue that we don&#8217;t understand fully at the moment. The noise in the system now with that gyro is such that it cannot be used to point Hubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the shuttle fleet retired and no chance to make any additional repairs or upgrades in orbit, NASA earlier developed &#8220;control laws&#8221; that would allow Hubble to operate with two gyros or even just one. If it eventually comes to that, the plan would be to skip the two-gyro mode and go directly to single-gyro control to preserve the life of the remaining unit.</p>
<p>But Sembach said that&#8217;s not yet being considered. Instead, the team opted to &#8220;put the observatory into a safe-point mode that it could stay in for ages if it needs to while an investigation occurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>While optimistic the problem can be resolved, he said Hubble can operate in near-normal fashion with just one gyroscope if worse comes to worse, although it would be more difficult to track fast-moving targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;So things closer in in the solar system than, say, the orbit of Mars, that would be more difficult,&#8221; he said. In addition, Hubble would have to rely more on its star trackers and magnetometers to determine its orientation and aiming, effectively reducing the amount of sky it could &#8220;see&#8221; at any given moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t see the whole sky at some time during the year, we can,&#8221; Sembach said. &#8220;It just might be if we have to look at a particular region of the sky at a particular time Hubble may not be able to point there because of that extra restriction when we&#8217;re in a reduced-gyro mode. Otherwise, it&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commercial launcher lifted off from Vandenberg, a military base about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, at 7:21:28 p.m. PDT Sunday (10:21:28 p.m. EDT; 0221:28 GMT Monday).</p>
<p>Climbing into a clear evening sky, the Falcon 9 pitched downrange south from Vandenberg, exceeded the speed of sound in about one minute, then shut down its nine Merlin main engines at around T+plus 2 minutes, 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Four seconds later, the first stage dropped away from the Falcon 9&#8217;s second stage at an altitude of more than 250,000 feet &#8212; about 77 kilometers &#8212; then pulsed cold gas thrusters to flip around reignite three of its Merlin engines to reverse course and head back to Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>
<p>The rocket&#8217;s comet-like appearance in the skies over Southern California prompted countless social media posts, with spectators sharing imagery of a bulbous exhaust cloud created by Falcon 9&#8217;s first and second stage engines. The engines on each stage were firing simultaneously as one part of the launcher headed into orbit over the Pacific Ocean, and the first stage steered back toward the coast.</p>

<p>Three of the first stage engines reignited again after the &#8220;boost-back&#8221; burn to brake for landing, and the booster&#8217;s center engine fired moments before touchdown at Landing Zone 4, located a quarter-mile (400 meters) from the Falcon 9&#8217;s launch pad at Vandenberg.</p>
<p>The Falcon 9 settled back on its concrete landing pad, emblazoned with a stylized &#8220;X&#8221; in the center, less than eight minutes after liftoff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vandenberg, LZ 4, the Falcon has landed,&#8221; a member of SpaceX&#8217;s launch team announced as the booster returned to Earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Falcon 9&#8217;s second stage accelerated into orbit with the thrust from its single Merlin engine. The rocket&#8217;s nose cone jettisoned once the rocket climbed above the boundary of space, and SpaceX did not attempt to recover the fairing on Sunday night&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p>The rocket released Argentina&#8217;s SAOCOM 1A radar observation satellite just shy of the 13-minute mark in the mission. U.S. military tracking data indicated SAOCOM 1A was orbiting around 385 miles above Earth, following a polar orbit track inclined 97.9 degrees to the equator, close to pre-flight targets.</p>
<p>The successful launch Sunday was SpaceX&#8217;s 17th mission of the year, and SpaceX&#8217;s fifth launch from Vandenberg in 2018.</p>
<p>With Sunday night&#8217;s mission, SpaceX has recovered one of its first stage boosters 30 times, a tally which includes 18 landings on drone ships at sea, 11 returns to Cape Canaveral, and now one landing at at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>

<p>The launch of SAOCOM 1A also marked the 16th time SpaceX has reused a Falcon 9 booster. The first stage that launched and landed Sunday first flew July 25 on a previous flight from Vandenberg with 10 Iridium communications satellites.</p>
<p>The satellite’s purpose is to scan the Earth with an L-band steerable synthetic aperture radar, enabling all-weather imagery of the planet day and night. Radar imagers can see through clouds and are effective 24 hours a day, but optical cameras are hindered by clouds and darkness.</p>
<p>SAOCOM 1A is the first of two identical radar observation satellites developed by CONAE, Argentina’s national space agency.</p>
<p>The final phase of construction of the SAOCOM 1B satellite has started at INVAP&#8217;s factory in Bariloche, Argentina. Its launch is planned on a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base some time between October and December of 2019, according to Laura Frulla, principal investigator for the SAOCOM mission at CONAE.</p>
<p>The new radar satellites will help measure soil moisture, and will watch for oil spills, floods, wildfires and other natural and human-caused disasters. The soil moisture data will provide scientists and agricultural planners information about the wetness of soil to a depth of more than 6 feet, or 2 meters, information that will help predict harvest yields, floods and droughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The SAOCOM mission is mainly dedicated to soil moisture, but you can identify features in urban areas, too,&#8221; Frulla said in an interview Saturday with Spaceflight Now. &#8220;The sensitivity of the instrument is quite good. We can have applications in agriculture, fishing, forestry, climate science, oceanography, natural resources, urban planning and geology.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of the environment, you can estimate biomass,&#8221; Frulla said. &#8220;This is a good feature of using L-band. You can also have snow maps and water maps, and these give you some knowledge about the management of water, mainly for regions that don&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>SAOCOM 1A is the first radar imaging satellite built in Argentina, and it will comprise part of a joint Argentine-Italian project to share complementary radar surveillance data between the SAOCOM satellites and Italy’s Cosmo-SkyMed constellation.</p>
<p>Frulla said the entire SAOCOM project, including two satellites, two launches and a ground station, cost around $600 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;SAOCOM will be a partially commercial mission, that is to say if you want to have commercial use of the data, you have to pay,&#8221; Frulla said. &#8220;We will give the data free to all institutions that are helping the government and for academic use around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SAOCOM satellites are manufactured by a consortium of Argentine companies led by INVAP. Parts of the SAOCOM radars were produced in Italy, according to Frulla.</p>
<p>SAOCOM 1A&#8217;s radar has a best resolution of about 10 meters, or 33 feet.</p>
<p>The twin SAOCOM spacecraft will form a six-satellite constellation with Italy&#8217;s Cosmo-Skymed satellites. The SAOCOM satellites will fly in roughly the same orbit as the four Cosmo-Skymed spacecraft, allowing Cosmo-Skymed X-band radars and SAOCOM L-band radars to observe the same location on Earth about 10 minutes apart, Frulla said.</p>
<p>The X-band and L-band radar bands resolve different features on Earth&#8217;s surface, with the L-band capable of penetrating into the soil to sense moisture content.</p>
<p>&#8220;When SAOCOM acquires, 10 minutes later Cosmo-Skymed acquires,&#8221; Frulla said. &#8220;So you have nearly simultaneous images of the same area, and you can see different aspects of the surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frulla said one of the first tasks of the SAOCOM ground team is to deploy the new satellite&#8217;s radar instrument, which was folded up during launch to fit inside the Falcon 9 nose shroud.</p>
<p>The radar imaging array will extend to a length of around 33 feet, or 10 meters, and a width of more than 11 feet, or 3.5 meters. The first images from SAOCOM 1A should be captured and downlinked around 20 days after launch, Frulla said.</p>
<p>After a series of calibrations and testing, SAOCOM 1A should be ready for operational service by March 2019, she said.</p>
<p>Frulla said the SAOCOM satellites are designed to operate for five-and-a-half or six years.</p>

<p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was raised vertical at Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Sunday ahead of a planned liftoff with Argentina&#8217;s SAOCOM 1A radar observation satellite, and the first landing of a SpaceX booster on the U.S. West Coast.</p>
<p>The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) rocket was set for liftoff at 7:21:29 p.m. PDT Monday (10:21:29 p.m. EDT; 0221:29 GMT Tuesday) from the SLC-4E launch pad at Vandenberg. The Argentine-built SAOCOM 1A spacecraft, carrying a synthetic aperture radar imager for Earth observation, will ride the commercial launcher into orbit around 385 miles (620 kilometers) above Earth.</p>
<p>For the first time, SpaceX plans to return the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket to Vandenberg, a military facility located on California&#8217;s Central Coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
<p>SpaceX has landed 11 rockets at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station following launches from Florida, and another 18 boosters have touched down intact on the company&#8217;s ocean-going downrange drone ships. But none have returned to landings in California.</p>
<p>That is set to change with Sunday&#8217;s launch after lengthy environmental reviews and final preparations of the concrete landing pad at Vandenberg, dubbed Landing Zone 4. The landing target sits on the site of a former Titan 2 launch pad, around a quarter-mile (400 meters) from the Falcon 9 launch pad at SLC-4E, a site previously used by Titan 4 rockets.</p>

<p>The relatively light weight of the SAOCOM 1A spacecraft &#8212; around 6,600 pounds (3,000 kilograms) &#8212; combined with the payload&#8217;s target orbit less than 400 miles above Earth allow the Falcon 9 to reserve sufficient propellant for the return to launch site landing maneuvers.</p>
<p>Less fuel reserve is needed to steer the first stage toward a drone ship downrange at sea.</p>
<p>SpaceX plans to inspect the stage for potential reuse on a future mission. Going into Sunday&#8217;s launch, the booster already has one flight in its history &#8212; a July 25 launch with 10 Iridium communications satellites. The rocket landed on SpaceX&#8217;s drone ship and returned to port in California for inspections and preparations for another launch.</p>
